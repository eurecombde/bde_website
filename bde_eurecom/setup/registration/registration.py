TEXT1 ='Dear students,\n\nWho hasn\'t struggled to find and to choose the best accommodation ? And this only for a 1 year rental ! This is why I\'m very proud to announce you the launch of the Eurecom Housing website, a collaborative web platform to help the future students to find accommodations.\n\nThe idea of this website is to add the informations of your accommodation to the website, so that the future students will find easily the informations they need, in a well presented database.\nThis will be accommodations for students presented by students, so don\'t hesitate to be precise and to talk about all the drawbacks, unlike agencies that would hide the bad points. Contributions can be made exhaustive if you want to help much. Everything should be guided, go in \"My Account\" click on \"Create a new House\" and follow the instructions.\nIf you need an example, you can check the TCup apartment which is fully contributed.\n\nTime to bring your contribution now, log on the website at https://bde.eurecom.fr/housing/ with your login :'
# Credentials are included between the 2 texts
TEXT2 = 'Don\'t try to answer this email, it wouldn\'t reach anybody.\n\nIf you need to report a bug, or if you feel interested in the project and want to contribute or maintain the website, send me an email at Geoffrey.Dudragne@eurecom.fr\n\nCredits to Bastien ACHARD who co-developed the website with me.\n\nWaiting for your contribution.\nThanks to everybody.\n\nGeoffrey'
